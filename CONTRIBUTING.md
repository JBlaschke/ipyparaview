#Contributions to iPyParaView

We're happy to accept contributions to iPyParaView, and just require that you
sign off on any commits you make.

## Sign your work

A sign-off sits on the last line of the explanation for any code changes you
commit, and serves as an affirmation that you wrote the changes you are
committing and want to make it an open-source contribution to the project.
In more formal terms, your sign-off means that you can guarantee the
following:
```

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

If you affirm all of that, then just add a line like the following to every
git commit message:

    Signed off by: <YOUR NAME> <YOU@email.com>

You'll have to use your real, legal name. If you set `user.name` and
`user.email` in your git config, you can sign off automatically via the `-s`
flag: `git commit -s`.
